This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Instructions to run locally

1. On your local machine, navigate to or create a directory for the repo (i.e., cd projects/ or mkdir projects && cd projects)
2. Clone the repo (i.e., git clone https://github.com/handlez36/stop-raining.git).
3. This repo makes use of third party Apis, and therefore requires api keys for access to those services. Contact owner for the required .env.development and .env.production files.

   3b. Alternatively, you can create your own .env.development and .env.production files at the root directory, and input any existing api keys. Use the following environment variable names...

   REACT_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=API_KEY  
   REACT_APP_OPEN_CAGE_API_KEY=API_KEY

   Please ensure these are included in your .gitignore file.

4. Install all packages for the project (i.e., yarn install)
5. Now you should be able to run the project (i.e., yarn start)
